Uncorked - database driven web application

This application runs off of a database of over 60,000 wines. Users can search for a wine to get information about the product as well rate and review the wine.

To run the program, the wine database must be created. The flask framework and Python must be installed on the computer and the application is run by using the command 'python application.py' at the command propmt from the directory containing the Uncorked folder.

The uncorked_Demo.mov file contains a video demo of the application.
