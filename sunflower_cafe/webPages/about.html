			<h2>"I don't think we're in Kansas anymore"</h2>
			<p>Sunflower Cafe's roots are in the founder's home state of Kansas, but with a Wisconsin twist. Founded by Kelly East, a Kansas City native, this cafe brings together the best of both these great places. Sunflower Cafe specializes in brunch and light lunch foods with bakery goods available for dine in or take out. We hope Sunflower Cafe is a place for friends and family to come together for quality time and conversation over a meal, cup of coffee, or tasty treat.</p>
			<p>We have also introduced the Sunflower at Sunset series of events where we bring in local musicians and artists paired with craft beers and wine from the area. Come out with friends to taste the local flavor! See our <a href="events.html">events</a> page for more information.
